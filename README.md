# HOTEL-BOOKING-DATA-ANALYSIS
The goal of this project is to analyze hotel booking data to identify key trends, patterns, and insights that can help improve business operations, customer satisfaction, and revenue management.

# Problem Statement
 Hotels receive a large number of bookings, but many of them are canceled or modified. Understanding the factors affecting booking cancellations, customer preferences, and seasonality trends can help hotels optimize     their strategies to increase profitability.

 # Key Questions to Address
   1.	What is the average length of stay for different customer types?
   2.	Which types of rooms are most and least preferred by customers?
   3.	What percentage of total bookings get canceled?
   4.	What is the average daily rate (ADR) across different seasons?
   5.	Which countries or regions generate the highest number of bookings?
   6.	Which booking channels bring the most revenue and the highest cancellation rates?

 # Tools Used
 ### 1.	MS Excel 
For the Data Cleaning, null Handlings and Data Analysis.

 ### 2.	MS Power BI
